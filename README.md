## Skip the Dishes React Hackaton

Webapp developed with React.js.

Functionalities already deployed:

* User sign in / sign up
* Browse cuisines / restaurants / products
* Add product to cart
* Remove items from cart
* Place order

BONUS FEATURE:

As the API does not allow to place an order with products from multipple stores, I created a way to place more than one order from just one cart, acting as a marketplace:
